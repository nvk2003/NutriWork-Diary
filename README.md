The aim of this application is that is serves as a system that the users can use to make their own workout and meals
routine that they want to follow for a better living. This system allows the users to input the workout and meals
details that they want to follow. The users can view the workouts and meals that are categorized accordingly and also
categorized by the days in a week.

The application will primarily be used by:
